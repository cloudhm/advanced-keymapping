In order to get most of this post, please read [OSX-shortcuts-you-might-not-know](https://github.com/yifanchen/OSX-shortcuts-you-might-not-know) first. 

In this post, I am going to talk about how and why I map `hjkl` as `arrow` keys. For the mapping to work, you will need to use either of the following tools. 

[Karabine](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner): Arguably the most powerful key mapping tool, free makes it even better.

[BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/): BTT is very intuitively easy to use, it is no longer free, however spending few bucks to have it 24/7. I am totally down.

### HJKL

I started to use Vim last year. I absolutely like model editing and the idea of mouse-less. `hjkl` is the one of the most beautiful thing in Vim. I wanted to take the idea system wise. It turned out better than I thought. Now I it for everything, check out emails in Mail, browse files in Finder, go through lists in Slack, etc. I can't imagine a day without having it.

BTT is really powerful, the price of it made it even better(free). Now, it is no longer free, however with 3.00 bucks, can't complain if we use it all the time.

玩vim有感，觉得hjkl做为方向键再合适不过了。试想一下，打字的时候，光标可以左右切换并且手指不需要离开键盘的黄金位置。用多了发现就离不开了。

`control` + `hjkl`：左下上右。

我喜欢`hjkl｀是因为vim的原因，如果不用vim的话，可以用
