In order to get most of this post, please read [OSX-shortcuts-you-might-not-know](https://github.com/yifanchen/OSX-shortcuts-you-might-not-know) first. 

In this post, I am going to talk about how and why I map `hjkl` as `arrow` keys. For the mapping to work, you will need to use either of the following tools. 

[Karabiner](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner): Arguably the most powerful key mapping tool, free makes it even better. I did even send couple emails to the author, and guess what, I got responses back within 8 hours.

[BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/): BTT is well known, and very intuitively easy to use. It is no longer free, however spending few bucks to have it 24/7. I am totally down. In this post, I am not going to show how BTT works, it's very easy to figure out.

### About HJKL

I started to use Vim last year. I absolutely like model editing and the idea of mouse-less. `hjkl` is one of the most beautiful inventions in Vim. I wanted to apply the idea to the entire system. It turned out better than I thought. Now I use it for everything, checking out emails in Mail, browsing files in Finder, going through lists in Slack, etc.

After you map it the way like I do, the beautiful part happens:

`control` + `cmd` + `h` or `l`: navigating through beginning and end of a line.

`control` + `cmd` + `shift` + `h` or `l`: select entire line.

`control` + `cmd` + `k` or `j`: top or bottom of the file

`control` + `cmd` + `shift` + `k` or `j`: select entire file from either top or bottom.

`control` + `j` and `control` + `k`: very useful to go up and down of search result in google.

`control` + `l`: very useful to attach parameters to the end of a url.

Now, you can navigate through lines of code without moving right hand to arrow keys, how awesome is that!

玩vim有感，觉得hjkl做为方向键再合适不过了。试想一下，打字的时候，光标可以左右切换并且手指不需要离开键盘的黄金位置。用多了发现就离不开了。然后，我开始寻找这样的方式，发现了神级快捷
